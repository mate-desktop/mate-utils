"the root folder will be represented in the first ring, and deeper levels in "
"the tree correspond to outer rings in the chart. Each subfolder is "
"represented by a sector of the ring, its angle being proportional to the "
"size of the folder's contents, and painted with a different color to ease "
"visualization. Up to five levels can be drawn; in case that a folder in that"
" last fifth level contains even more subfolders, this situation will be "
"pointed by the presence of a black curve close to the edge of that folder's "
"ring sector. When a folder with no further subfolders is selected to be the "
"root of the partial tree, only the inner circle will be drawn. When the "
"mouse pointer hovers one of the folders in the graphic, it will be "
"highlighted and a tooltip will appear with information about its name and "
"size. If there are any subfolders, small gray tooltips will appear, "
"indicating their names. It's possible that not all of the subfolders' names "
"are displayed, to avoid overlappings."

"You can go up and down the rows in the list (optionally expanding those with"
" subfolders), the graphic representation will change using the selected "
"folder as the root of the partial tree to be represented. The folders can "
"also be navigated from the <guilabel>ringschart</guilabel> itself. If you "
"click with the left button of your mouse inside a folder, you'll move deeper"
" by setting the root of the graphic to that folder. If you press the middle "
"button (no matter the place as long as you click inside the "
"<guilabel>ringschart</guilabel> frame) you'll get the opposite behavior, "
"going back one step in the hierarchy."

"The percentage of its parent's radius that is used by a given folder is "
"directly proportional to the relation between its own size and its parent's."
" It's easy to understand that the size of a folder is equal or smaller than "
"its parent's. Although only directories are shown in this graphical "
"representation, files are taken into account to calculate the amount of "
"space occupied by folders."

<!-- ============= Introduction ============================== -->

  <sect1 id="baobab-introduction"> 
    <title>Introduction</title> 

      <para><application>&app;</application> is a graphical, menu-driven
      application to analyze disk usage in any Mate environment. <application>&app;</application> can easily scan
       either the whole filesystem tree, or a specific user-requested directory 
       branch (local or remote). </para>
       <para>It also auto-detects in real-time any changes 
       made to your home directory as far as any mounted/unmounted device. 
       <application>&app;</application> also provides a full graphical treemap 
       window for each selected folder.</para>

        <para>To start a full filesystem scan select <menuchoice><guimenu>Analyzer</guimenu><guimenuitem>Scan Filesystem</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
    from the menu, or press on the <guibutton>Scan Filesystem</guibutton> toolbar button.</para>

	<para>When the scanning process ends up, you will get the full tree of your filesystem,
	like the one in the next Figure.</para>

	as the thread starts scanning the filesystem. If any large partition is mounted 
	on the filesystem, that will be scanned too.</para></note>
    
    <para><application>&app;</application> will display sizes in the 
    directory tree as allocated space. This means that the displayed sizes refer 
    to the actual disk usage and not to the apparent directory size. 
    If you want to view the apparent file size, uncheck <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Allocated Space</guimenuitem></menuchoice> .</para>
    
    <warning><para><application>&app;</application> will not count the /proc dir, nor
    any file size that is not related to a "plain" file, so symlinks, character blocks,
    device blocks will not be part of the directory size.</para></warning>
   
    <para>Hard-links are managed in a different way: this first hardlink is 
    counted as a normal file, while the subsequent links to the same inode device 
    are not counted in the total, but highlighted in the right-hand column of the 
    window.</para>

<!-- ================ Treemaps ================================ -->

  <sect1 id="baobab-treemaps"> 
  <title>Treemaps</title>

      </figure>
    <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->
  
    
    <para>Figure shows an example of treemap's theory. Each node 
    (as shown in the tree diagram) has a name (a letter) and an associated size 
    (a number). The size of leaves may represent for instance the size of individual 
    files, the size of non-leaf nodes is the sum of the sizes of its children.</para> 
    
    <para>The treemap is constructed via recursive subdivision of the initial rectangle. 
    The size of each sub-rectangle corresponds to the size of the node. 
    The direction of subdivision alternates per level: first horizontally, 
    next vertically, etcetera. As a result, the initial rectangle is partitioned 
    into smaller rectangles, such that the size of each rectangle reflects the size 
    of the leaf. The structure of the tree is also reflected in the treemap, 
    as a result of its construction. Color and annotation can
	be used to give extra information about the leaves.</para>

	<note><para>Treemaps are very effective when size is the most important feature to be 
	displayed.</para></note>

  <!-- ================ Ringschart ================================ -->

  <sect1 id="baobab-ringschart"> 
  <title>Ringschart</title>

    <para><guilabel>Ringschart</guilabel> is a graphical
      representation of the disk usage by a concrete folder. When
      launching the application, it is notified the usage of
      the file system as it can be seen in the next figure:</para>

    <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
    <figure id="baobab-filesystem_scan"> 
      <title>&app; showing a ringschart with the file system usage</title>

	</mediaobject> 
      </screenshot> 
    </figure>
    <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

    <para>When you start scanning a folder, the tree of subfolders is
      created and listed on the left side. Each row contains
      information for the name, how much space it is taking up
      (percentage and size in KB, MB or GB) and the number of items
      (adding files and directories). When this process ends up,
      the <guilabel>Ringschart</guilabel> is drawn on the right
      side. If you stop it before it has been completed, only a
      partial representation is done based on the directories whose
      usage was computed.</para>


    <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
    <figure id="baobab-folder_scan"> 
      <title>&app; showing a ringschart with the usage of a folder</title>
      <screenshot> 
	<mediaobject> 
	  <imageobject>

	</mediaobject> 
      </screenshot> 
    </figure>
    <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->
    
    <para>The <guilabel>Ringschart</guilabel> is composed of a set of 
      nested rings around a central circle. This circle symbolizes the
      root folder of the partial tree (that is, the folder that the 
      user has selected for scanning). Each ring represents a level in
      the partial tree, so i.e. the subfolders of the root folder will 
      be represented in the first ring, and deeper levels in the tree 
      correspond to outer rings in the chart. Each subfolder is 
      represented by a sector of the ring, its angle being proportional 
      to the size of the folder's contents, and painted with a different
      color to ease visualization. Up to five levels can be drawn; in 
      case that a folder in that last fifth level contains even more 
      subfolders, this situation will be pointed by the presence of a 
      black curve close to the edge of that folder's ring sector. When a
      folder with no further subfolders is selected to be the root of 
      the partial tree, only the inner circle will be drawn. When the 
      mouse pointer hovers one of the folders in the graphic, it will be
      highlighted and a tooltip will appear with information about its
      name and size. If there are any subfolders, small gray tooltips
      will appear, indicating their names. It's possible that not all of
      the subfolders' names are displayed, to avoid overlappings.</para>

    <para>You can go up and down the rows in the list (optionally 
      expanding those with subfolders), the graphic representation will 
      change using the selected folder as the root of the partial tree 
      to be represented. The folders can also be navigated from the 
      <guilabel>ringschart</guilabel> itself. If you click with the left
      button of your mouse inside a folder, you'll move deeper by 
      setting the root of the graphic to that folder. If you press the 
      middle button (no matter the place as long as you click inside the 
      <guilabel>ringschart</guilabel> frame) you'll get the opposite 
      behavior, going back one step in the hierarchy.</para>

    <para>The percentage of its parent's radius that is used by a given
      folder is directly proportional to the relation between its own
      size and its parent's. It's easy to understand that the size of 
      a folder is equal or smaller than its parent's. Although only 
      directories are shown in this graphical representation, files are 
      taken into account to calculate the amount of space occupied by 
      folders.</para>

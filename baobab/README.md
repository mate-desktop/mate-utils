Baobab
=========
Baobab is the MATE Disk Usage Analyzer.

What is Baobab
==============
Baobab is able to scan either specific directories (local or remote) or the whole filesystem, in order to give the user a graphical tree representation including each directory size or percentage in the branch. It also auto-detects in real-time any change made to your home folder as far as any mounted/unmounted device.

System Requirements
===================
Baobab should build on  most unices. It needs the X11R6 (or xorg) libraries, GLib, and GTK 3.x.
